    <center><h3>Time Management and Organization</h3></center>
<p>Time management and organizational habits are by far the most crucial factors of a successful student, and developing these structured habits will help you become very efficient while studying. I recommend creating a planner for yourself where you write down your homework that is due the next day and the tasks that need to completed that night. Additionally, in the planner I would write down the tests, quizzes, and projects due in the current and upcoming weeks to ensure that you are not forgetting about assessments until the night before. The functionality of this planner serves to keep all of your assessments and assignments organized and it creates a to-do list of what you need to complete for homework each night. Secondly, while doing homework it is necessary to study for tests and quizzes for more than two days before the assessment to ensure the long-term retention of the information. When doing homework it is helpful to study for tests and quizzes first and then periodically testing yourself with questions or topics that you struggle with understanding or remembering when completing other work. This allows for your brain to fully comprehend and understand the given information that you are struggling with because of the repetition of reviewing it. Finally, eliminating procrastination while studying will help you tremendously. A few ways to do this is to set an alarm at a set time to tell you when to study, place your devices in another room to reduce distractions, and study in a quiet place without distractions.Â </p>

<center> <h3> Note Taking, Asking Questions, and Removing Distractions in the Classroom </h3> </center>
<p>
    At times school can be tiresome and boring. Trust me I understand, but staying focused and attentive in class will benefit you tremendously for tests and homework. When in class, remove all distractions to help you focus during lectures and take notes, even when it's a boring subject, because it will help you when reviewing for the test. Taking notes and paying attention in class allows your brain to fully process the given information, and this will most definitely help you with the comprehension and memorization in the subject. Also, use your teachers to your advantage, ask questions, go to help sessions, and stay after class to clarify confusing information. Advocating for yourself in the classroom will grant you information, clarity, and more confidence. For me personally, I used to get very nervous asking questions and getting clarification at school but something to remind yourself is that your teachers are there to help you and guide you. These habits can be difficult to begin at first but practicing them now will benefit you in the future.</p>
